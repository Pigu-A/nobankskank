Hello SillyVenture how you doin!
AYCE cominatcha with a completely expansion-free demo! We got fed up with not being able to watch c00l demos on our 64k Ataris, so we made our own! It ain't anything groundbreaking but betcha it looks swell as fuck! An important note - all members of AYCE are sexy and unmarried.
Also, all of them hail from BATTLE OF THE BITS - a webzone when artists of all kinds come to compete in various compos, Atari included! Check us out at battleofthebits.org, join us, and try your best in the Atari Trilogy battle until December 2nd!
AND NOW TO THE NEXT PART...
